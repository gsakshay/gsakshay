# Hello, I'm Akshay! üëã

## Software Engineer | CS Master's Student @ Northeastern University

üîç **Actively seeking Full-time roles in Software Engineering and Full-Stack Development** (May 2025)

üöÄ Passionate about building impactful, scalable systems and user-centric solutions. Proficient in **JavaScript, Python, Web Development**, and **Distributed Systems**.

## Experience
From modernizing financial services at Annaly Capital Management to delivering scalable e-commerce solutions at Maestro Technologies, my journey has been about creating impactful, efficient software. At Annaly, I streamlined trade processing with RabbitMQ and Redis, reduced audit findings, and optimized microservices to achieve impressive performance gains. At Maestro, I improved load times and scalability by leading Next.js projects and deploying microservices on AWS. Earlier at Nymble, I amplified the efficiency of cooking robots, implemented robust state management, and managed microservices using modern JavaScript frameworks. My earlier experience as a Frontend Engineer also laid the foundation for designing intuitive dashboards and contributing to cross-functional project success. Together, these experiences reflect my dedication to merging user-centric design with technology that scales.
